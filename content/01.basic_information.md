## Description of the course

Welcome to CEE Data Science!
This semester, you  will learn to leverage data to study civil and environmental engineering problems, identify patterns, and make actionable insights.
This course combines training in digital and computer tools—including distributed computing, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modeling and deep learning—with application of those tools to civil and environmental engineering issues.

This course differs from other available machine learning and data science courses in that it focuses on civil and environmental engineering problems and the methods used to solve them. In particular, this course emphasizes working with spatial data, which is common in physical science but less common in data science when applied to other disciplines.

By the end of the semester, you will be able to:

1. Use software tools for data processing and visualization, machine learning, and deep learning to
2. Retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data; and
3. Make inferences and predictions about the (built) environment.

This course will help you to gain the skills and tools necessary to make the most of the great increases in the amount and quality of data related to civil and environmental engineering that is being collected and stored.

Because data science methods are used across a number of different industries and instructional materials are readily available, this course will include readings and video lectures from across the internet.
We will focus our face-to-face time on learning aspects of civil and environmental data science that differ from data science as used by other fields, and on applying data science concepts to solving physical problems.
This course will be structured around semester-long projects; students will choose project topics at the beginning of the semester and will apply the concepts learned in the class to their projects as the semester progresses.

## Prerequisites

* CEE 202;
* CEE300, 330 or 360; and
* CS 101 or equivalent.

## Course Structure

This course is structured as a series of modules, with each module containing recorded lectures, readings, and quizzes to be completed before each class meeting.
Class meetings will be held on Zoom to go into further depth on the material that was covered in recorded lectures and readings.
Near the beginning or the semester, students will choose a topic for a project, which they will work on throughout the semester, applying the concepts that we learn in class.
Additionally, students will complete homework assignments and a midterm and final exam.

## Course Requirements and Assessment Overview
* Grades will be assigned based on several types of deliverables:
  * Discussions: 3% of final grade
  * Homeworks: 17% of final grade
  * Midterm exam: 15% of final grade
  * Final exam: 25% of final grade
  * Course project: 40% of final grade: 5% for literature review, 15% for Kaggle competition, 2.5% for exploratory data analysis, 7.5% for final presentation, and 10% for final report.
* Graduate students are expected to register for 4 credits and undergraduates are expected to register for 3 credits. Correspondingly, course projects for graduate students are expected to include a machine learning component that is more complex than linear regression, whereas for undergraduates this is optional.
* Letter grades will be assigned according to the following scale:
  * 97-100:	A+
  * 94-96.5:	A
  * 90-93.5:	A-
  * 87-89.5:	B+
  * 84-86.5:	B
  * 80-83.5:	B-
  * 77-79.5:	C+
  * 74-76.5:	C
  * 70-73.5:	C-
  * 67-69.5:	D+
  * 64-66.5:	D
  * 60-63.5:	D-
  * Below 59.5:	F


## Homeworks and Exams

Homeworks and Exams will be done through [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/course_instance/89830/assessments).
In assigning these types of homeworks and exams, I'm placing emphasis on **mastery**.
The idea is to keep doing questions until you master the underlying concept or method. Once you do, you should be able to answer these questions very quickly.

Before doing the assessments, you will need to enroll in this class in PrairieLearn.
To do so, go to [https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/enroll](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/enroll) and click on "Add course" next to "CEE 498DS: Data Science for Civil and Environmental Engineering, Fall 2020".

**Important**: When you log in to PrairieLearn, choose "Log in with Illinois" rather than "Log in with Google" or "Log in with Microsoft".
The UIUC login is the only one that will work.

### Homeworks

For the homeworks, I try to encourage preparation for class before a module starts, so if you finish all of the questions completely before the first meeting time for the module, you will receive 110% of the available points.
Questions finished between the first and second meeting times of the module receive 100%, and questions finished up to two weeks after the module ends can receive 80%.

Note that new homeworks are assigned most weeks, so if you don't stay ahead, it can be easy to fall behind.

### Exams

Exams are also administered using PrairieLearn. 
For exams, partial credit isn't given, but you can try each problem more than once, with a decreasing number of points possible for each try.

## Time commitment

The University guidelines for course credit hours are posted [here](https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/courses/credit-hour-definition/). 
In summary, students in a 3-credit class are expected spend at least 6 hours per week, and students in a 4-credit class are expected to spend at least 8 hours per week, working outside of class times on readings, assigned lectures, assignments, projects, and test preparation.

It is my goal for this class to follow these guidelines so let me know if you think it does not (keeping in mind that the guidelines are for the *minimum* effort requirements).

## Learning Resources
* Students are expected to bring have use of a laptop for class.
* There is no required textbook to purchase. Course material will draw from a number of sources across the internet.
* Some supplemental textbooks which students may find useful are:
  * Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython
  * Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow
  * https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/
