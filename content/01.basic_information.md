## Description of the course

Welcome to CEE Data Science!
This semester, you will learn to leverage data to study civil and environmental engineering problems, identify patterns, and make actionable insights.
This course includes training in computational thinking and exploratory data analysis; data processing techniques including singular value decomposition, principal component analysis, and fourier and wavelet transforms; and machine learning techniques including k-means, classification trees, neural networks, and neural differential equations.

This course differs from other available machine learning and data science courses in that it focuses on civil and environmental engineering problems and the methods used to solve them. In particular, this course emphasizes working with dynamical systems that generate spatiotemporal data, which are common in physical science but less common in data science when applied to other disciplines.

By the end of the semester, you will be able to:

1. Use software tools for data processing and visualization, signal processing, and machine learning to
2. Retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data; and
3. Make inferences and predictions about the built and natural environment.

Specifically, upon completion of this course, you should be proficient in the following **course learning objectives**:

1. When given a mathematical equation or the description of an algorithm, to use computational thinking to create a software implementation of that equation or algorithm.
2. To carry out exploratory data analysis to visualize, summarize, and explain an unfamiliar dataset.
3. To use a distributed version control system to collaborate on a project.
3. To choose and execute coordinate transforms represent and interpret the underlying patterns in a dataset.
4. To apply the gradient descent algorithm to minimize error between a model prediction and observations.
5. To design and implement machine learning models to cluster or predict a dependent variable in a dataset when given independent variables.
6. To monitor machine-learned models for bias using disaggregated testing.

This course will help you to gain the skills and tools necessary to make the most of the great increases in the amount and quality of data related to civil and environmental engineering that is being collected and stored.

Because data science methods are used across a number of different industries and instructional materials are readily available, this course will include readings and video lectures from across the internet.
We will focus our face-to-face time on hands-on practice with the tools and concepts we are learning in this class.
For students taking the class for four credits, it will include semester-long group projects; students will choose project topics at the beginning of the semester and will apply the concepts learned in the class to their projects as the semester progresses.

## Prerequisites

* CEE 202;
* CEE300, 330 or 360; and
* CS 101 or equivalent.

## Course Structure

This course is structured as a series of modules, with each module containing recorded lectures, readings, and quizzes to be completed before each class meeting.
Class meetings will be hybrid in-person and on Zoom, and will focus on hands-on application of the material that was covered in recorded lectures and readings through the use of in-class worksheets.
The in-class worksheets will be graded, but will not count toward the final grade. Instead, students who have an average worksheet score of at least 90% (averaged among all worksheets) will be allowed to drop their lowest-scoring midterm exam.
Near the beginning or the semester, 4-credit students will choose a topic for a project, which they will work on throughout the semester, applying the concepts that we learn in class.
Additionally, students will complete homework assignments, 3 midterms and a final exam.

## Course Requirements and Assessment Overview
* Grades will be assigned based on several types of deliverables:
  * Pre-lecture quizzes: 5% of final grade
  * In-class worksheets: 11% of final grade. (70% of points can be made up by completing the post-class worksheet review. Online students can get 100% of points by completing the post-class worksheet review.)
  * Homeworks: 20% of final grade
  * Midterm exams: 39% of final grade (13% each).
  * Course project (4-credit students only): 25% of final grade: 
    * 3% for project selection and introduction, 
    * 3% for exploratory analysis, 
    * 3% for preliminary modeling, 
    * 3% for report rough draft, 
    * and 13% for final report and presentation.
  * Extra credit: Students can create "Tiktok-style" videos explaining or reviewing the concepts covered in the course. For each module in the course, the creator of best video (as judged by the instructor) will receive **1% extra credit** toward their overall grade for the class. Videos with multiple authors can split the extra credit among the authors.
* Graduate students are expected to register for 4 credits and undergraduates can choose between 3 and 4 credits. For 3-credit students, there will be no course project and the weights of the other assessments will be scaled accordingly.
* Letter grades will be assigned according to the following scale:
  * 97-100: A+
  * 93-96.9:	A
  * 90-92.9:	A-
  * 87-89.9:	B+
  * 83-86.9:	B
  * 80-82.9:	B-
  * 77-79.9:	C+
  * 73-76.9:	C
  * 70-72.9:	C-
  * 67-69.9:	D+
  * 63-66.9:	D
  * 60-62.9:	D-
  * Below 59.5:	F


## Homeworks and Exams

Homeworks and Exams will be done through [PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.org/pl/course_instance/128749/).
In assigning these types of homeworks and exams, I'm placing emphasis on **mastery**.
The idea is to keep doing questions until you master the underlying concept or method. Once you do, you should be able to answer these questions very quickly.

**Important**: When you log in to PrairieLearn, choose "Log in with Illinois" rather than "Log in with Google" or "Log in with Microsoft".
The UIUC login is the only one that will work.

### Homeworks

For the homeworks, I try to encourage preparation for class before a module starts, so if you finish all of the questions completely before the first meeting time for the module, you will receive 110% of the available points.
Questions finished between the first and second meeting times of the module receive 100%, and questions finished up to two weeks after the module ends can receive 80%.

Note that new homeworks are assigned most weeks, so if you don't stay ahead, it can be easy to fall behind.

### Exams

Exams are also administered using PrairieLearn. 
For exams, partial credit usually isn't given, but you can try each problem more than once, with a decreasing number of points possible for each try.

## Learning Resources
* Students are expected to bring a laptop to class, and have use of one and an internet connection for homeworks and pre-class activities.
* There is no required textbook to purchase. However, much of the course follows the book *[Data Driven Science and Engineering](http://www.databookuw.com/)* by Brunton and Kutz. The book includes a freely avilable [pdf version](http://www.databookuw.com/databook.pdf) and lecture videos, is also available for sale in hardcover and ebook formats.
* The course also includes content from the [Julia learning resources](https://julialang.org/learning/), which is also a good resource for learning Julia in general. The free course *[Introduction to Computational thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/)* from MIT is particularly well done.
* For students that want to continue beyond the material covered in this course, there is [*Parallel Computing and Scientific Machine Learning*](https://github.com/mitmath/18337) (another course from MIT) and [*Deep Learning*](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.
